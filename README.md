# Introduction
This is a application of convolutional neural network. The model is trained to identify number from 0 to 9 in different images.

# How to run the code
1. If you are using IDE such as Pycharm, then it is easy to run the code
2. If you are using VScode, you will have to install the required library and jupyter notebook to ensure the compatibility of the code

# After running the code:
After running the file, the model will start training (~20minutes), it will be able to identitfy number from 0 to 9 in different images.
The desired accuracy of this model is ~94%.
